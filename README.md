# Mano-Alga-Dot-Lt-Scraper
The purpose of this project is to show my ability to extract data from web page. To do so, I used python libraries like BeautifulSoup. For working with data sets I used Pandas labrary. For visualisarion - matplotlib and seaborn.

You can see my work in jupyter notebook file "Mano-Alga-Dot-Lt-Scraper.ipynb"
Scraped data is saved in file "position_list.csv"
